By applying the **Rashomon Effect**, businesses can better understand complex customer feedback and uncover hidden insights.  

## Features  
- **Multi-Perspective Sentiment Analysis** – Goes beyond binary classifications to provide a layered understanding of feedback.  
- **AI-Powered Insights** – Uses **Python (NLP models)** to analyze textual data with depth.  
- **Enterprise-Ready Architecture** – Built with **.NET (C#)** for seamless integration into existing business systems.  
- **Customizable Viewpoints** – Allows businesses to define their own perspectives for tailored analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **.NET (C#)** – Backend logic and API development  
- **Python (NLP)** – Text processing and sentiment analysis  
- **SQL** – Data storage and retrieval  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Web-based dashboard for visualizing insights  

## Use Cases
